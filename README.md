#50 Days of LeetCode Challenge: Mathematics & DSA

A Journey of Dedication, Growth, and Problem-Solving:

Hello! I’m Yashasvi Jaiswal, an aspiring Cybersecurity student with a strong interest in algorithms, logical thinking, and real-world problem-solving. With the fast-evolving world of technology, I believe that a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), along with mathematical problem-solving skills, is foundational—not just for software engineering, but for cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and system-level thinking as well.

To challenge myself and push my learning further, I’ve taken up a "50 Days of LeetCode" challenge focused specifically on Mathematics and  DSA-based problems.

This repository is my open journal and portfolio for this journey. Every single day, I solve and upload problems, share insights, analyze patterns, and document what I’ve learned—not just to keep myself accountable, but to contribute back to the community, and most importantly, to showcase my problem-solving mindset to potential employers and collaborators.

 Why This Challenge?

Consistency Builds Mastery-
  Solving problems daily helps me sharpen my logical thinking and keep my coding instincts active.

Cybersecurity Needs Deep Thinking-
  My long-term vision is to work in the field of Cybersecurity, where identifying vulnerabilities and thinking like an attacker requires analytical depth. DSA and math prepare my brain to think that way.

Stand Out Through Action-
  Anyone can list "DSA" on a resume. I want to *prove* my dedication with real, consistent effort that you can actually see.

Self-Discipline & Initiative-
  This challenge is self-imposed. No grades, no deadlines—just pure motivation to grow, improve, and stand out.

 What You'll Find in This Repository:-

Daily LeetCode Submissions-
  Neatly organized by topic and difficulty, each with clean, well-commented code.

Mathematics-Based Approaches-
  Special focus on number theory, combinatorics, primes, modulo arithmetic, and more.

In-Depth Explanations-
  I don’t just post solutions—I explain the why behind them.

Time & Space Complexity Analysis-
  Performance matters, especially in security-critical systems.

Reflections & Learning Notes-
  Key takeaways, challenges faced, and how I overcame them—documented regularly.
